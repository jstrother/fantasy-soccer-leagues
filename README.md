# fantasy-soccer-leagues

A fantasy soccer league designed to retrieve players' game stats, calculate fantasy points earned per match, determine whether fantasy matches are won/drawn/lost, and then update fantasy league standings accordingly.  There will eventually be promotion/relegation, champions' league, and club world cup (looking for a better name for this last one so FIFA doesn't sue me).
