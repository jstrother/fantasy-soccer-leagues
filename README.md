# fantasy-soccer-leagues

This is a final project for school.

A fantasy soccer league designed to retrieve players' game stats, calculate fantasy points earned per match, determine whether fantasy matches are won/drawn/lost, and then update fantasy league standings accordingly.

Simply go to the link above and sign up. Once you're in, name your team, select a league, and then choose your players! It's as simple as that! The program will determine scheduling and match results behind the scenes, so all you need to do is make sure your lineup is good for the week.

Please note that player statistics are outdated as I couldn't afford to keep paying for the API as a student.
